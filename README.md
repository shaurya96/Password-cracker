**Designing Password Cracking Strategy**
This project focuses on decrypting SHA-1 hashed passwords stored in "passwords.txt." Starting with the verification of User 1's password, "123456" [here](sha1-online.com) the objective extends to strategically cracking a significant portion of the password file. Leveraging common password-setting practices, including simple digits, English words, and combinations, the project employs Python and Hashcat to design an effective cracking system.
